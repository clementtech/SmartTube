Option 2:
- Download the apk : [**Install**](https://github.com/yuliskov/SmartTube/releases/download/latest/smarttube_stable.apk)
- Transfer it to your Android TV and install from there

**The app has a built-in updater** with changelog.

# Installation (Chromecast with Google TV)

On **Chromecast with Google TV**, installation of apps is blocked by default, so an extra step is required:

> **4.1. Enable Developer Options**
>
> On your Chromecast/Unifi TV, open the side menu and go to _Settings > System > About_. Scroll down to the _Android TV OS build_ section and click that repeatedly. A toast message will appear, explaining that you are a few steps away from being a developer. Continue clicking until you trigger it.
>
>
> **4.2. Turn on the "unknown sources" setting**
>
> Go back to the main _Settings_ page and select _Apps > Security & Restrictions > Unknown sources_. Turn on the toggle for \[_Downloader by AFTVnews_ or\] whichever file browser you decided to use [...].

> After this, you can follow the [general installation guide](#installation) above.


### Updating

The app has a built-in updater. You only need to follow the installation procedure **once**. A few seconds after launching SmartTube, it will notify you if there is any update and also show a changelog. You can disable automatic update checks or manually update in the settings under "about".

If the installation fails, either your **disk space is full** or the update didn't download correctly; clear up space and try updating again (_Settings > About > Check for updates_).
